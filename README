RESEM
==============

The Shrewd way to handle your emergencies.
--------------
Instead of using the traditional phone call service to handle the emergency, this app propose a One Touch method to deal with the emergency situation. The user will be having an Application on his/her Mobile Phone which can be accessed directly by a single touch on the screen instead of the traditional way of making a call to the emergency operator. Once the App is launched, immediately the geo-location of the user is transported to the Resem Emergency Serverr along with his/her unique identity. Based on this our system immediately gathers all the information about the user and at the same time will inform the Emergency Service Department to take instant action. Along with this the user information required by the Insurance Department is sent to the Insurance Department so that they can insure the user at the time of Emergency.
